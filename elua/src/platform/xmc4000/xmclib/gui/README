Notes:

The OLED display on the XMC4500's extension HMI board can be
programmed by using the GUI_SEGGERLIBRARY APP within the DAVE IDE from
Infineon. While the GUI_SEGGERLIBRARY's code is available, it relies
on the non-free (free as in freedom) graphics archive library from
Segger (GUI_basic_xmc4.a and its advanced counterpart). The library is
shipped with DAVE and is linked with the user's program (in our case,
eLua) when the project is configured to use the OLED.

From a section in Segger's terms:

> This file has been licensed to Infineon Technologies AG, a german
> company at the address Am Campeon 1-12 in 85579 Neubiberg, Germany
> and is sublicensed and distributed by Infineon Technologies AG in
> accordance with the DAVE (TM) 3 Software License Agreement to be
> used for and with Infineon's Cortex-M0, M0+ and M4 based 32-bit
> microcon-troller products only.
> 
> Full source code is available at: www.segger.com

So, as long as this library is used by an Infineon Cortex device, they
are OK.

I would only assume that it is OK to move the non-free (yuck!) archive
outside the context of DAVE. I'm sorry Segger and Infineon but
SpaceShip is a lot of fun! Only if you gave us the source code.

For Segger's terms, please see one of their header files in
xmclib/gui. The non-free library belongs to Segger. The
GUI_SEGGERLIBRARY APP is shipped by Infineon as a DAVE APP. The terms
for that can be found in gen/GUI_SEGGERLIBRARY.
